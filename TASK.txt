This Technical Task is to illustrate the thought processes and ability to be able to
consume data, check data and insert the data into an SQL containerised
database. Please provide your code via relevant means (such as Github) and a ReadMe 
file explaining how to run your code. Note your approach, thoughts, any problems
you encountered and how they were overcome for discussion.

Our platform is progressing towards using Redshift to store and query all
data sources, this is injected into by multiple different pipelines. Development of
these pipelines is the primary objective of the successful applicant alongside
other backend work. Javascript is our primary language throughout using NodeJs
within our microservice architecture. New sections of the pipeline are constructed
using Python and Flask. Feel free to use either of these technologies. Our backend
is setup via docker containers and managed by DCOS and integrated through
Circle CI.

The task aims to consume data from a csv through a web api, use it to infer and
create an appropriate table for SQL with the correct data types, perform some
basic outlier detection on it and insert the data into an SQL container using the
language of your choice if no outliers are detected. Thereâ€™s no need to make a
frontend; you can simply use something like postman to upload the csv to the
web service.
We would like you to Dockerize your application and to aid we have provided you
with a base docker compose file ( use docker-compose to connect the containers)
to simplify the process to remove the need to configure postgres although feel
free to use any sql database:

The Test:

You are provided with two test csv files. One that passes and one that fails
shown here:

============================================================================================================

cek header, harus valid (jangan pake angka di awal atau tanya gpt lagi buat detailnya harus gimana)
pisahin data dari header
buat metadata
cek outlier
create table
import table
return metadata




jangan lupa harus bisa handle dynamic table
gimana caranya buat programnya di mode easy, agressive dst
